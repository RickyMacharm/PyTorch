        "Tensors are a type of data structure used in linear algebra, and like vectors and matrices, you can calculate arithmetic operations with tensors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Computation in PyTorch is driven by what has come to be called PyTorch Tensors. Most of the patterns that are found in Numpy Arrays can be transformed into PyTorch Tensors.\n",
        "\n",
        "In computer vision problems, images can easily be broken down into a few hundred features. \n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, tensors can be best viewed as containers that wrap and store data features in the context of machine learning and deep learning, and are sort of a generalized representation of vectors and matrices. \n",
        "\n",
        "Before we proceed, we need to understand some words: _**scalars**_, _**vectors**_ and _**matrices**_.\n",
        "\n",
        "**A scalar** is a zero-order tensor that only contains a single element, such as x1. In real life, examples of scalar representations include: length, time, distance,area,speed, temperature,energy, power and mass.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Vectors** are first-order tensor since they only have one axis. In Python vectors are usually encapsulated in square brackets like a `list` and is represented thus:\n",

        "``` \n",
